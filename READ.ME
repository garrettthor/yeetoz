YEETOZ is a Yelp-like/Instagram-like app that allows users to submit posts of burritos.

Individual users can post pictures, descriptions, prices, location+restaurant info with a rating (1-5 stars) on their burrito.

Other users will then like that post, which reflects OP's overall reputation as a burrito-ranker.

The feed can be sorted by date/time, by rating, or proximity to a location.
